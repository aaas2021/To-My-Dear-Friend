# To-My-Dear-Friend
If you ever wanted to know what a Chinese person who grew up in the West thinks about race, sexuality, THIS IS IT. This is my ultimate piece of writing and a distillation of my knowledge about the world into just 100 pages. The book documents two decades of my journey in the West, starting from the early 2000s up to literally today (12/31/2020). It chronicles the bullying I've faced in school, my introduction to anti-racist literature and my own subsequent observations about the world and the uncharted waters of anti-Asian racism. It also discusses some of my thoughts on the on-going red-scare. 

The book is written in the style of a letter to a friend, who is also a Chinese male immigrant. Please keep in mind of this because I won't be able to discuss everything I ever thought about regarding all the injustices facing the world.  

The book was extremely hard to write because it thoroughly documents my personal destruction at the hands of white supremacy. I apologize to you in advance should you feel hurt or discomfort when reading it.  I chose to remain anonymous because the book writes about many still living people and I am not at a stage of my life where I can be candid with my parents and friends about these topics. I'm not even 30 yet. 

The book also sets a record of sorts since it was literally conceptualized on 12/12, the day I decided to leave my friend, officially started on 12/17 and finished on 12/31. I have written it using an existing LaTeX template, widely available online. Please let me know if you are ever interested gathering your thoughts into this format.
