# To-My-Dear-Friend
If you ever wanted to know what a Chinese person who grew up in the West thinks about race, sexuality, THIS IS IT. This is my ultimate piece of writing and a distillation of my knowledge about the world into just 100 pages. The book is written in the style of a letter to a friend, who is also an Chinese male immigrant. Please keep in mind of this because I won't be able to discuss everything I ever thought about injustice facing the world.
